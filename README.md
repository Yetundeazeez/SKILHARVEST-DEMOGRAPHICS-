## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset was imported into Power BI for data cleaning and transformation:
There are no duplicate values in the dataset
All the data types are correct
The missing value in the country column was replaced with NAN. This was done to avoid deleting the row since the number of responses is small.
Then the dataset was loaded into power BI for proper visualization.
